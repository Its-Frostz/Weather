# Weather Data Cleaning - Algorithm & Process

## How It Works

Here's the step-by-step algorithm used to clean the weather data:

## Algorithm Overview

### Step 1: Smart File Loading
```
Try different encodings → Find header row → Load data
```
- Tries multiple encodings (utf-8, latin-1, cp1252, iso-8859-1) until one works
- Searches for the line containing "Date & Time" to find where real data starts
- Skips metadata rows and loads only the actual data table

### Step 2: Duplicate Column Detection
```
For each column name:
    Remove .1, .2, .3 suffixes → Group by base name
```
- Goes through all column names like "Temperature.1", "Humidity.2"
- Strips off the numbered suffixes to get base names
- Groups columns that have the same base name together

### Step 3: Value Comparison Algorithm
```
For each group of similar columns:
    Convert to strings → Compare row by row → Count differences
```
- Takes columns that look similar (like "Temp" and "Temp.1")
- Converts all values to strings to handle mixed data types and missing values
- Compares them element by element to see if they're actually identical
- Counts how many rows are different and calculates percentage

### Step 4: Smart Cleaning Decision
```
If columns are identical:
    Keep first one, remove others
Else if columns are different:
    Rename with descriptive suffixes
```
- If two columns have 100% identical values → remove duplicates, keep one
- If columns have different values → rename them clearly (like "Temp_Secondary")
- Never loses data, just makes column names clearer

### Step 5: Apply Changes & Save
```
Rename columns → Drop duplicates → Preserve file format → Save
```
- Renames confusing columns first
- Removes true duplicates 
- Keeps original file structure and metadata
- Saves cleaned version with UTF-8 encoding

## The Process in Action

1. **Load file** → Try encodings until one works
2. **Find duplicates** → Group columns by base name (remove .1, .2 suffixes)  
3. **Compare values** → Check if grouped columns have identical data
4. **Clean smartly** → Remove true duplicates, rename different ones
5. **Save result** → Keep original format, clear column names

## Why This Algorithm Works

**Handles encoding issues**: Many weather files have special characters (°, %) that break with wrong encoding

**Finds real duplicates**: Just because columns have similar names doesn't mean they're duplicates - this checks the actual data

**Preserves information**: Never deletes columns with different data, just renames them clearly

**Robust comparison**: Converts everything to strings first, so it handles missing values, numbers, text, etc.

**Maintains structure**: Keeps original file metadata and row order intact

### 4. **Smart Cleaning Strategy**
## What Happened to Your Data

Since the columns contain different values, the script:
- **Keeps all data** (no information is lost)
- **Renames confusing column names** for clarity
- Changes names like "Temp - °C.1" to "Temp - °C_Secondary"
- This makes it clear these are separate measurements, not duplicates

## Results

**Original Dataset:** 67,478 rows × 72 columns  
**Cleaned Dataset:** 67,478 rows × 72 columns

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ 0 columns removed (no true duplicates found)
- ✅ 14 columns renamed for clarity
- ✅ All data preserved
- ✅ Row order maintained
- ✅ Original file unchanged

## Key Finding

Your weather dataset doesn't actually contain duplicate columns! What appeared to be duplicates (columns ending in ".1") actually contain **different measurement data**. These likely represent:

1. **Primary sensors** (without suffix): Main weather station measurements
2. **Secondary sensors** (with .1 suffix): Backup or additional sensor measurements

The script intelligently renamed these columns to make their purpose clear while preserving all valuable data.

## Files Created

1. `weather_data_cleaned.csv` - Your cleaned dataset with clear column names
2. `weather_data_cleaning_final.py` - The complete cleaning script
3. Analysis scripts for detailed data exploration

The cleaned dataset is now ready for analysis with clearly labeled columns and no ambiguous names!
